# Middleware Transmission technology evaluation
Repository to evaluate the best transmission technology for a low-latency, large payload scenario

## Getting Started

Before running the applications, you need to modify, both the published and subscriber running script and Dockerfile. 
Replace `<...>` with the correct values for your environment. This is used when choosing the starting container (mostly for DDS related applications).

Files:
* `publisher/dev-ipc.sh`
* `publisher/Dockerfile.dev`
* `subscriber/dev-ipc.sh`
* `subscriber/Dockerfile.dev`
* `create_base_docker.sh`

## Structure

The folder structure of this projects is described as:
* `publisher`: Contains the publishers application that produces and sends the data
* `subscriber`: Contains the subscribers application that receives and processes the data
* `results`: Contains the results of the evaluation, with the logs generated by all applications
* `create_base_docker.sh`: Script to create the base docker image for all applications,

## Results

In the `results` folder, we can observe all the logs. The most important are the subscriber ones. 
The tests were conducted by sending **100** messages with a size of **~4MB** each.
What we observed, was that Zenoh as the best performance, with a latency of **3.79ms**, ZeroMQ in second, with **5.73ms**. 
DDS testing was divided in three scenarios:
* The first with the `large_data` flag, which has **16.51ms** of average latency, however appears to have a large packet loss ratio (>50%).
* The second which has `SHM` transport and `UDP` enabled, with a shared `IPC`, achieving **22.69ms** of average latency.
* The third also has `SHM` transport and `UDP` enabled, but no `IPC` (meaning no shared memory use), achieving **24.21ms** of average latency
